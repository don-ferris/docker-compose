Testing to ensure that machines on VLAN 50 cannot access anything outside their own VLAN involves checking the firewall rules and performing some tests. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Review Firewall Rules:

Go to "Firewall > Rules > GUEST_WIFI_VLAN."
Confirm that there are no rules allowing traffic from GUEST_WIFI_VLAN to other VLANs or subnets.
Perform Ping Tests:

From a machine on VLAN 50, try to ping devices on other VLANs or subnets.
If there are specific devices on other VLANs, try pinging their IP addresses.
If there are other VLANs, try pinging the VLAN interfaces' IP addresses.
Check Internet Access:

Confirm that machines on VLAN 50 can still access the internet.
Review NAT Rules:

Go to "Firewall > NAT > Outbound."
Confirm that the outbound NAT rules are set up appropriately. By default, pfSense should automatically create rules for each interface.
Verify Isolation:

If you have devices on other VLANs or subnets, try accessing a machine on VLAN 50. There should be no access unless there are specific rules allowing it.
Check pfSense Logs:

Review the pfSense firewall logs for any unexpected or denied traffic. Look for entries related to traffic from VLAN 50 to other VLANs.
Test Specific Services:

If there are specific services running on machines in other VLANs, try accessing them from VLAN 50. For example, try connecting to a file server or a printer.
Wireshark Packet Capture:

For more in-depth analysis, you can use packet capture tools like Wireshark to inspect the traffic. Capture packets on the VLAN interfaces to see if there is any unauthorized communication.
By systematically going through these steps, you can ensure that the VLAN 50 network is appropriately isolated from other VLANs or subnets. If you encounter any issues or have specific questions during this process, feel free to let me know!
